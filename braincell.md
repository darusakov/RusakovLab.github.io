Introducing **BRAINCELL 1.0 **: A platform for biophysical exploration of brain cells and their environment on the scale from nanomenters to hundreds of microns. 
This tool bridges the theoretical aspects of computational neuroscience with real-world applications, offering 
an immersive environment for researchers, neuroscientists, and medical professionals to study the brain's 
complex internal mechanics, react to various stimuli, and evaluate the impact of neurological treatments.

At its core, **BRAINCELL** builds upon the acclaimed NEURON simulation environment, augmenting it with 
sophisticated features such as detailed inter-cellular interactions, spatially variable parameters, 
the incorporation of external influences, and the integration of stochastic elements. These 
enhancements significantly expand the possibilities within computational neuroscience.
